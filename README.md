Our project Ven – You is an Event Management System Website that 
will help an event organizing company manage their client event details and market the client event also. 
This is a website with only user interface and allows users to go through the services provided and book 
for the events of their choice. The website provides the details of events, venues, caterers, decorators 
along with the pricing and other necessary details for the users to choose from. Further, if the 
users have any doubts or clarifications or if they need extra information about any event or venue, we 
have provided the contact details through which they can reach us.


In this website, we have the home page, followed by the events page which contains all the events offered by us along with its details. Next is the locations page, that contains the venues where we provide our services, along with the details of each location, seating, pricing etc. We have also included the food styles offered and décor styles in the following pages. After the users login to our website, they can have a look at the previously booked venues, dates and accordingly book their events. There is also a provision for the users to give their feedback as it is valuable to us and also enables other users to have a look at it.
